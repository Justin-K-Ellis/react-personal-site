    "para2": "I first came to Japan as an English teacher in Nagano Prefecture, and then transitioned to developing content for standardized English tests at Benesse, the largest educational company in Japan. While there, I had the opportunity to work on a couple of AI-powered English testing apps, where I was responsible for developing standards for the scoring system and gathering and preparing training data for deep learning models. I was also responsible for coordinating (and translating for) our Japanese team at Benesse, partner development companies in Japan, and data scientists in India.",
    "para3": "This involved using Excel a lot (where I learned to appreciate the power of the function, a good intro to programming in itself), and got me interested in software development in general. I ended up teaching myself Python and was able to automate some work, and then got interested in web development. I learned a lot about fullstack JavaScript development at The Odin Project, and then decided to challenge myself even further by joining a full-time, intensive programming bootcamp at Tokyo's Code Chrysalis.",
    "para4": "It was a tough four months (about one month for the online precourse, and three for the on-site immersive course), but I came out able to develop fullstack applications both autonomously and on a team. I also learned a lot about testing and agile workflows (especially when I lead the development of my group's final project, a big learning experience itself).",
